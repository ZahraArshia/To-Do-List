# To Do List
"To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize daily activites. It simply lists the things which are needed to be done and allows user to mark them as complete.
In this step of project, the CRUD (create, update, delete) methods are implemented. This simple web page is built using webpack and served by a webpack dev server.
